How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Gathering requests from potential users in a face to face is a great way to implement their needs into a program.  Developing user stories
allow the development team to prioritize and decide which requests can add value to the project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my approach to developing, I prefer the Agile method.  The iterative process allows for a development team to build upon a product in smaller 
managable steps. In the future I hope to incorporate the SCRUM process into my work, I feel that the openess and level playing field allows every
one on the team to feel ownership of the product and ensures a level of quality that may not exist in methods like waterfall. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being receptive to input and criticism, listening to others opinions, taking ownership of the work, and treating everyone with respect.
